<span id="id1"></span><h1>Feature Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>All feature requests are considered. So please feel free to offer any that you
have. However, please be aware that this library is generally maintained to
help reduce that amount of repetative code that we write for our software.
Therefore things are normally prioritised based on what we need at the time.
If you would like to <a class="reference internal" href="#contributing"><span class="std std-ref">Contribute</span></a> something you have added please do
so. I&#8217;d recommend letting me know if you plan to work on something though, to
avoid conflicting additions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contribute">
<span id="contributing"></span><h1>Contribute<a class="headerlink" href="#contribute" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If you use (or are thinking of using) this library and believe there are some
things that you would like to add to it, please do! If you have any questions
I&#8217;m more than happy to discuss how aspects of it work. Over time I plan to
add more details on the design here as well.</p>
<p>If you plan to work on something perhaps let me know so we don&#8217;t have repeated
effort, or overlapping work. If you&#8217;d like to contribute something, but
you don&#8217;t know what I have a long list of things like I&#8217;d like to get done.</p>
<div class="section" id="main-requirements">
<span id="contributing-stuff"></span><h2>Main Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#main-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most obvious missing feature at the moment is FMP unit coverage. Focus up
to this point has been getting the API reasonably solid and making sure that
the foundations are in place. The amount of FMP units currently included is
therefore a bit limited (partly by design and not wanting to re-write them
all after changes). Normally we will add new units when they are needed for
a script or a tool. If there is one that you need it is probably a good place
to start with contributions.</p>
<p>Have a look at <a class="reference internal" href="contributing/addingaunit.html#addaunit-top"><span class="std std-ref">Adding a new AUnit</span></a> for a walkthrough on what needs to be done
to build a new unit.</p>
<p>It would also be great if you could let me know if you&#8217;re planning on working
on anything. Then we can try and avoid duplicated effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h2>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The API has a suite of unit tests for all of its components. These use the
Python UnitTest Framework. Unit tests allow for the software to be fully
checked to make sure that it operates as intended by ensuring all behaviour is
reviewed for a range of circumstances.</p>
<p>If you want to better understand the API the tests are a good place to start.
The tests show how the functions should be working. They should also help
to better understand some of the data structures.</p>
<p>There is a folder within the library called “tests” that contains the
UnitTestSuite.py file. This file calls all of the individual tests. All new
functionality should have unit tests written and stored in this package.</p>
<p>Whenever any changes are made to the code base in the API the full suite of unit
tests should be run to check that the changes have not broken any other part of
the code base. These should be done with &#8220;tox&#8221; to ensure that a clean
environment is used and it is checked against both python 2.7 and 3.5. There
is a &#8220;tox.ini&#8221; file in the main folder. If you do:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cd SHIP
$ tox
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the tox.ini file should take care of the rest.</p>
<p>There is also a set of integration tests in the &#8216;integration_tests&#8217; folder.
These deal with more realistic use of the API (loading actual model data and
changing some stuff to see what happens). They don&#8217;t use the UnitTest
framework, they&#8217;re just a few modules with a __main__ module. When you update
the library they will almost certainly fail until updated themselves. Probably
don&#8217;t worry too much about them when you add content; I&#8217;ll have a look at them
later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging">
<h2>Logging<a class="headerlink" href="#logging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All logging is done through the use of the Python built in logging API. “print”
statements should not be used for debugging.</p>
<p>Where output is needed use: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">logger.mychosenlogginglevel(‘mydebugmessage’)</span></code></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Where mychosenlogginglevel (in order from top down) is:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>error</li>
<li>warning</li>
<li>info</li>
<li>debug</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Normal outputs will probably be set to info, so anything for developer only purposes
should be set to debug. Anything the user might find helpful should be set to info
and any problems should be set to warning or error.</p>
<p>The logger should be requested at the top of every module using:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">utils</span> <span class="n">Import</span> <span class="n">log</span>
<span class="n">logger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setup_custom_logger</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using logging in this way means that there won’t be print statements littered
throughout the code and it’s easy to change the output formatting, logging level
etc in the master log file in utils.log, which will have a global effect.</p>
